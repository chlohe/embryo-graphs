# VIA On Steroids
A fork of VGG Image Annotator (VIA) for annotating focal stacks.

## What's changed?
- You can generate VIA projects from a directory of embryo focal stacks. We expect the directory to look like...
```
directory
├── embryo 1
    ├── F0.jpg
    ├── F15.jpg
    ...
├── embryo 2
...
```
- You can automatically save the project in the GUI by pressing "s".
- You can load projects by dragging them into the workspace.
